## 1. Local Method (Safest and Recommended)
If you have openssl installed on your machine,
you can generate your own keys by running the following commands:
```bash
:~$ openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048
:~$ openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem
```
Then copy the keys to the ".keys" folder

## 2. Online Method (Not Recommended)
You can use the following website to generate your own keys:

‚ö†Ô∏è Caution: Using an online method can expose your keys to potential theft over the internet. It's strongly recommended to use this method only for local development and to prefer OpenSSL for generating keys securely.
